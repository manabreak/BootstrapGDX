# BootstrapGDX
A bootstrap project for creating LibGDX games.

This is a rather simple bootstrap project that combines together
common stuff I tend to use whenever I make games or try out new
ideas.

If you have ideas on how to improve this, feel free to create pull requests!

## Features

So far, this bootstrap project has the following things set up:

- A LibGDX project featuring Android and desktop projects

- Artemis ECS system with common systems and components in-place

- Retrolambda

- Simple resource handling

- Automatic texture atlas creation when running the desktop build

## Upcoming

These are upcoming features I've planned to implement. These are
in no specific order and may or may not be implemented. Ever.

- Generic QuadTree implementation
